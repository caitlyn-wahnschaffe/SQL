-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, then created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- Who are the top three artists that have the most songs in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS Track_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY Track_count desc
LIMIT 3;

-- What is the average danceability, energy, and liveness by artist for songs in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name,AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(liveness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

-- Top ten tracks by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc;
LIMIT 10;
